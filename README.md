# robotic-arm
this is a general roadmap for the project

## phase 0 - investigation
figure out what exactly are we trying to make, make and iterate on the design to make sure it is robust enough. try to keep things modular so stuff can more easily change later.

## phase 1 - final design
settle for a complete design. make a model to be built/printed and assembled irl.

## phase 2 - basic arm
build and test the basic arm movements to make sure things work as expected and can withstand the future challanges. make adjustments if necessary.

---
make new and fun stuff with it!
